<a name="about"></a>

Lunar represents a modernized iteration of classic Roblox administration systems, such as "HD Admin" or "Kohl's Infinite Admin." Notably, it incorporates a role-based ranking system similar to Discord's role structure. Lunar distinguishes itself through its high configurability, allowing individual players to personalize settings such as their prefix, argument split key, theme, and more.

# Why Lunar? ‚òÑÔ∏è

With Lunar, administrators can seamlessly execute actions like kicking, banning, flinging, and a variety of other commands right from the user interface, ensuring a smooth experience without causing disruption for other players. Whether your game draws thousands or just a handful of players, Lunar effortlessly adapts to the player base.

In addition to its adaptability, Lunar stands out for its optimization and efficiency. It intelligently closes loops when not in use and offers a performance mode that disables features like tweens and smooth drag, enhancing Lunar's performance without compromising user experience.

Moreover, Lunar is highly customizable. Game developers have the flexibility to incorporate custom commands to themes, allowing them to shape and tailor Lunar to suit their specific needs and preferences.

Finally, ensuring security and reliability stands as our topmost priority. We meticulously test Lunar to identify and rectify any vulnerabilities, non-efficient code, or elements that might cause inconvenience to you.
